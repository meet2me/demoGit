		Of course you belong to a group. A Group of Staff or Managers in your Company or Non Profit Organisation, One of many customers of a local Hairdressers or maybe a parent of children that go to a local school.
		<p> Every one of these organisations, and any other Organization you can think of needs to communicate with their Group members.
		<P>Tell them about a cancelled meeting, send special offers or inform group members that the School or Organisation is closed due to Snow.

		Yes! Every Company or Non Profit Organisation has Groups of people that they need to contact or should be contacting. Many organisations have efficient email systems to contact people they have a relationship with, but there are many scenarios and groups that the current system probably does not deal with effeciently.
		<p>Some examples:</br>
		Does your Contingency Plan / Disaster Recovery Plan include a simple method to contact staff, customers and suppliers  by email and SMS even if you do not have access to your main email system. 
		<p>If you are a retailer or a charity do you have a way of contacting different customer groups on a regular basis to encourage them to return to your store - or to send them special offers or special charity appeal for help?
		<p>If you are a School or Youth Group do you have a simple way to contact parents, pupils or youth groups or staff / leaders? 
		<p>With GroupMessage.co.uk you can invite individuals you have a relationship with to join relevant Groups using a simple Mobile Friendly web page. Organisations can create Public Groups where anyone can instantly join and start receiving email and SMS messages or Private Groups where membership must be approved by a Group Administrator or Group Leader. These Group Members can update their information, reducing your administration of Groups.
		<P>Administrators and Group Leaders can use their desktop, laptop, tablet or smart phone to instantly send email or SMS to Groups. You have full control over whether you want to send a free email message or to pay for sending SMS.
		<p>Find out how easy it is for users to join groups and for Group Administrators or Leaders to send Messages to Group members by joining our <a href="http://groupmessage.co.uk/DemoAcc1UK/Demo" class="white-font"> Demo Group</a>.</p>
